            <h1>PROJECTS</h1>
            <p>Beyond the typical day-to-day analytics/business intelligence workflows, there have been a number of interesting buiness questions and problems that I had a lot of fun trying to solve for over the past few years:</p>
            <h2>VMG Insights Engine</h2>
            <h3>Business Question: <span class="question">Can we create a custom data product that streamlines business and content intelligence systems into a single, searchable source to empower non-technical users across the organization with relevant data and insights to drive business growth and innovation?</span></h3>
            <h3>Outcome: <span class="question">Working closely with the data and engineering teams, my team and I set out to build a technology platform that uses a distinctly innovative approach to data and insights. Our goal was to bring together and enhance data from across VMG globally to identify cultural and content trends surging at micro and macro levels using "logic" (technology) and "magic" (people). This investment in our data and data infrastructure would enhance our ability to see around corners, informing what we make, who we partner with and how we grow our business.
                <br></br>
                There were multiple phases to this initiative:
                <br></br>
            <ul>
                <li>Discovery + Diligence: 2 months of internal stakeholder interviews to identify user and business needs, wants, and opportunities to innovate along the way.</li>
                <br></br>
                <li>Collect + Connect: 1 month of cataloging and mapping key platforms and their respective metrics from within our data warehouse and insights portal.</li>
                <br></br>
                <li>Design + Test: 2 months of building Python integrations on top of our data warehouse, incorporating third party APIs, and building the first iterations of the data visualizations.</li>
                <br></br>
                <li>MVP + Enhance: 3 months of finalizing the data pipeline and creating a custom UI and rolling out the product to key teams to test and receive feedback for future product versions.</li>
            </ul>
        </span></h3>

            <h2>Rethinking Video KPIs</h2>
            <h3>Business Question: <span class="question">Beyond the typical KPIs (e.g., views, average time spent), are there any other metrics that may be worth considering when defining the success of videos?</span></h3>
            <h3>Outcome:</h3><p>Short blurb of text for Project 05.</p>

        <div class="project-item">
            <h2>Companion Brands</h2>
            <h3>Business Question: <span class="question">What is our take on a brand ranker similar to Forbes and Interbrand to drive new corporate press, increased sales leads, and strengthened existing client partnerships?</span></h3>
            <h3>Outcome: <span class="question">As young people seek to navigate the world around them and become independent--entering the prime of their social and professional lives--they look for someone to be by their side to make sense of and navigate this uncharted territory. Brands play an important role in this journey. But for brands it's not just about leading or challenging their respective categories--it's about having a purpose that aligns with their core consumers. This study identified the critical codes of conduct (e.g., respect, support, empowerment) to being a "companion" brand, and developed an index and ranking system to help brands to identify and evaluate their current capability as a companion to consumers.
                <br></br>
                Basic methodology:
                <br></br>
                 <ul>
                    <li>Exploration: Dug into previous research conducted, analyzed existing secondary research and gathered additional qualitative inputs from our audience to inform the attributes and brands included in the study.</li>
                    <br></br>
                    <li>Investigation: Fielded online survey with 2,759 Gen Z and Millennials respondents in the U.S., covering 200 brands across 14 categories.</li>
                    <br></br>
                    <li>Analysis: Created factors that clustered features together based on survey results to create critical "codes of conduct." Used ML classification model to determine predictiveness of a strong brand relationship for each code. Finally, each of the 200 brands was scored using this formula to determine their category rank and identify their unique strengths and weaknesses among the codes of conduct.</li>

                </ul>

            <h2>Brand Personas</h2>
            <h3>Business Question: <span class="question">As we think about how we position ourselves in the market among consumers, how does the way we describe our brand and our offerings differ from competitors in the market? What content offerings may be saturated in the market and what content offerings are not currently being fully met?</span></h3>
